# 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using several supervised Machine Learning classification algorithms.

The project follows a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow including:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Overfitting / Underfitting analysis
- Model comparison
- Visualization and interpretation

The dataset used is the famous **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset from Kaggle.

# 📂 Dataset

🔗 Dataset Source:  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

The dataset contains passenger information such as:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `Pclass` | Passenger class |
| `Sex` | Gender |
| `Age` | Passenger age |
| `Fare` | Ticket fare |
| `Parch` | Parents / children aboard |
| `SibSp` | Siblings / spouses aboard |
| `Embarked` | Port of embarkation |

### 🎯 Target Variable

```python
Survived
```

- `1` → Survived
- `0` → Did not survive

---

# ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Missing value handling
- Age imputation
- Cabin removal
- Encoding categorical variables

---

## 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

New features were created:

```python
FamilySize
IsAlone
```

---

## 3️⃣ Feature Selection

Feature importance analysis was performed using:

- SelectKBest
- Chi-Square Test

Final selected features:

```python
['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'IsAlone']
```
